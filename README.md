# CSC110 Final Project

### Purpose

To find correlations between public sentiment to climate change and government response to climate change. 

### Method

Uses the Twitter API to aggregate over tweets from a database of Tweet IDs, as well as gather new Tweets related to climate change. Uses a simple analysis to classify each tweet, then looks for patterns in certain locations. This is compared to other related economic indicators. Twython is used to interact with the Twitter API, Pygame is used to build the GUI, and Plotly is used to display the graphs.

To use the app, unzip the data file, install all requirements in requirements.txt, and run main.py.
